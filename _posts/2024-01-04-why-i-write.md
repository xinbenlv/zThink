# The first blog

## Why I write

This is the first and always going to be the first article for my publication.
I am going to write about why I write and what I am going to write about.

I will continue to append to this repository.
And it will be continuously pushed.

I push my note so I can get feedback and improve. 

Thank you for reading this.

And certainly this is going to be fun and enjoyable journey of self-expression and creativity. Writing provides me with a platform to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences with the world. It allows me to connect with readers and engage in meaningful discussions.

In this article, I will delve into the reasons why writing is such an integral part of my life. I will explore how writing not only helps me express myself, but also enables me to learn and grow as an individual. Writing allows me to organize my thoughts, clarify my emotions, and gain a deeper understanding of the world around me.

Furthermore, through writing, I am able to make a positive impact on others. By sharing my own perspectives and insights, I hope to inspire and motivate readers to reflect on their own lives and pursue their passions. Whether it is through storytelling, providing helpful advice, or simply sharing personal anecdotes, I strive to create content that resonates with others and sparks meaningful conversations.

Additionally, writing serves as a therapeutic outlet for me. It allows me to release any pent-up emotions or stress that I may be experiencing. Writing offers a sense of catharsis, helping me process my thoughts and feelings in a healthy and productive way. It provides a safe space for introspection and self-reflection, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of myself and my own inner workings.

Moreover, writing challenges me to constantly improve and refine my craft. It pushes me to expand my horizons, experiment with different styles and genres, and continuously evolve as a writer. The act of writing itself is a journey of growth and self-discovery, where I can explore new ideas, hone my skills, and push the boundaries of my creativity. It allows me to push past my comfort zone and explore new perspectives and voices.

In the future, I plan to cover a wide range of topics in my writing. From personal experiences and reflections on life, to social issues and current events, I aim to create content that is diverse, thought-provoking, and relevant. I want to provide readers with a variety of perspectives and insights that will both entertain and educate. Through my writing, I hope to create a space where readers can engage in meaningful conversations, challenge their own beliefs, and gain a deeper understanding of the world we live in. Overall, writing is not just a hobby or a means of communication for me, but it is a passion and a way of life. I am excited to embark on this journey of self-expression and creativity, and I look forward to sharing my thoughts and ideas with you. Thank you for joining me on this adventure, and I hope that my writing resonates with you and sparks inspiration in your own life. Together, let us embark on this journey of exploration, growth, and connection through the power of words. Stay tuned for more articles and updates, and I welcome your feedback and thoughts along the way. Let's create meaningful and impactful content together!

This is going to be published to my b.zzn.im very soon.

## How I write

I am applying [[pkg/"How to Take Smart Notes" by Sönke Ahrens]], which is a [[pkg/Zettelkasten 抽屉卡片]] approach. I rely on [[pkg/Obsidian]] as my main notes taker. I use [[pkg/git]], [[pkg/markdown]] to manage it. And thanks to [[pkg/WorkingCopyApp]], I am able to take notes on the go. I really hope to have [[pkg/闪念胶囊]] app created by [[pkg/Smartisan (锤子科技)]].

It turns out the [[pkg/Jekyll]] doesn't support wikilink very well yet.

## How you can participate

- You can subscribe to my SubStack.
- I will try to make it available on [b.zzn.im](https://b.zzn.im)
- And maybe an auto-audio version via [[pkg/Spotify]] and other [[pkg/Podcast]] device.
