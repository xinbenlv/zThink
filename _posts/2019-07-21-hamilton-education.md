I got interested in Alexander Hamilton, and started to read related Wikipedia articles from Musical to History. And it reads: ”The Church of England denied membership to Alexander and James Hamilton, Jr.—and education in the church school—because their parents were not legally married.“ Much like in China there was a time (1980-1990-ish) if people don’t have HuKou(户口) people will have problem for access to public school.

I once suspected how a Pope\'s Excommunication could be so powerful, for example, during the famous Investiture Contest the Pope\'s Excommunication effectively undermined the Heinrich IV, the then Holy Roman Emperor\'s political foundation. In a separate incidence, without a membership of the Church of England (I\'d call it a spun-off of Roman Catholic Church, the more I look into it, the more I think they have more in common than their differences), the young Alexander Hamilton was not granted access to typical education resource at the time. Thus a membership of the Church at the time, partially means the access to social support resource such as education. 

Good, that solved one puzzle. But it creates a new myth to me that is whether the introduction of Social Security (plus federal income tax) actually was the reason The United States started to become more of a single nation state than a union of many states. And How this will affect the road ahead of EU.

我最近对亚历山大汉密尔顿感兴趣，就开始阅读它的音乐剧和实际历史的维基百科。有一段关于汉密尔顿的童年教育的描述说到：因为其父母的婚姻合法性不被英国圣公会/英格兰教会认可，作为孩子的亚历山大汉密尔顿无法成为教会成员，于是无法在常规的教会学校上学。

我以前一直对教皇的“绝罚”到的为啥这么强大感到狐疑不解。例如，在著名的叙任权之争中，教皇的绝罚实质上导致了“当时”的神圣罗马帝国皇帝亨利四世的政治基础被削弱。美国国父汉密尔顿的少年时期，因为圣公会（虽然从罗马天主教独立出来，但是运作方式基本上算是罗马天主教会的一个翻版）的成员资格，他无法享受普通的教育资源。 因此，教会的成员资格意味着获得教育等社会保障的资源。（相当于中国的户口身份？）。 

很好，学习了一个新知，解决了一个问题！但是，这又带来一个新的疑问，就是，美国是否在引入了社会保障（ Social Security）之后，才慢慢真正开始成为一个单一的“民族”国家而不是多个州的联盟。这个问题的答案也会影响我关注欧盟最近的发展的分析方式。
