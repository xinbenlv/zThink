This site you are reading is my public blog and study notes. To understand why I publish my blog posts, essays or notes, read [Why I Write](https://b.zzn.im/blog/why-i-write/). This article describe how I write, and it's intended to be a live essay meaning it will be updated from time to time. Please feel free to come over and check for update.

## Currently
This site heavily relies on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and the tool I use to write is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and publish on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

I am applying the approach described in [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes) by [SÃ¶nke Ahrens](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/), which is a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) approach. 
### Build and debug locally

Follow the instruction on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

- Install Ruby `ruby-v3.1.4` via `ruby-install` and `chruby`
- Add to `$PATH`

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

## In the future
I like to be able to
- [ ] Use WikiLink
- [ ] Show a chart of knowledge graph
- [ ] Support perm-link
- [ ] Display Chart
- [ ] Add audio auto-reading
- [ ] Add transaltion button
- [ ] Add share button
