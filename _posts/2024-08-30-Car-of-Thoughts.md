In the past, we were accustomed to writing with a pen in hand, which felt like walking barefoot on the ground. Although slow, each step was steady and real. As technology advanced, typing replaced handwriting, and it was as if we had put on shoes, making our strides much lighter. Though we lost the direct contact with the earth, we reached our destinations much faster.

Then came voice input, offering us yet another choice, like riding a bicycle. We still controlled the direction, but our speed and efficiency improved significantly. No longer needing to exert ourselves with every step, we could quickly move forward as long as we maintained balance.

However, what truly amazed me was the advent of artificial intelligence. The arrival of AI felt like the first time humans possessed an internal combustion engine, elevating our speed and capabilities to an entirely new level. If moving from handwriting to typing and then to voice input represents the process of humans optimizing labor through different tools, then AI’s inclusion marks a new stage in our intellectual endeavors.

From a historical perspective, advancements in energy have propelled tremendous leaps in human civilization—from relying solely on muscle power to harnessing fossil fuels, leading to the Industrial Revolution. Now, AI symbolizes another leap in the realm of knowledge. It is not only an extension of our cognitive abilities but also a magnification of our capacity to process information and analyze data.

This process fills me with a sense of wonder. We are in a new era, one where external forces open up endless possibilities in the field of knowledge. This is not just technological progress; it is a rebirth of human intellect. I believe that in the future, we will continue to witness the surprises and changes that AI will bring us.
