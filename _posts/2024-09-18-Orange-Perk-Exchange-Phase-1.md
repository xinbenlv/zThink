# Proposal - Orange Perk Exchange (Phase 1)

Phase 1: Create an Orange Perk Exchange (Page) on Orange Portal

## Proposal
Orange DAO is built by founders; founders launch projects all the time. 
We propose a page on the Orange Portal to allow founders to share what they 
can offer to other founders from their company. For example, SaaS credits of 
their services, or discounts. 

For founders, it's a great way to find trustworthy early adopters. For other 
founders in the Orange, they can try new things, maybe at a discount or for 
free for a limited amount of time, and also have an opportunity to connect 
with the founders offering these perks.

For example, Namefi is building the next-generation domain platform. We offer 
a startup program and early adopter credits to allow people to try our 
platform for free. We want to be the first to provide it to Oranges.

## Steps and Budget
1. Design a display page of currently offered perks by Oranges - $1000 USDC for a designer
2. Design a mechanism to allow submission of perks, verifying their identity 
   as Orange DAO members. $1000 USDC for researcher
3. Implement on the platform - $2000 USDC for a developer

Total budget $5000 USDC

## Success Metrics:
1. How many perks are set up and provided by Oranges.
2. How many perks are being utilized.
3. How many oranges participated
4. How many LoI signed due to perks

## Roadmap Ahead
- Phase 1: MVP version, form-based submission, tile-based display.
- Phase 2: Integration between Orange DAO membership and the authentication 
  to founders' SaaS so the offering can be directly connected, and a Letter 
  of Intent can be signed; Access control (some perks only available to other founders who provided perks)
- Phase 3: World Peace! ðŸŽ©
