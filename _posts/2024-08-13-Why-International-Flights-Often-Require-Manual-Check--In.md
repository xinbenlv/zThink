# Why International Flights Often Require Manual Check-In

In my extensive experience with air travel, I've noticed a significant difference between domestic and international flights. While domestic flights often allow me to check in online through a platform, international flights typically require me to check in manually at the counter. This discrepancy not only leads to inefficiency but also increases my waiting time and psychological stress.

I believe the main issue is that international flights require the verification of each passenger's entry permit, and existing airline ticketing and boarding systems usually cannot handle the complex information associated with international travel documents. This issue is especially prominent on heavily trafficked international routes, leading to long lines and wait times. Moreover, many international flights only open their check-in counters three hours before departure, meaning that if passengers like me arrive early, we face long waits at the airport. This is inconvenient and can lead to additional fatigue and anxiety.

To address this issue, I suggest defining an international standard for format standards and programming application interfaces to facilitate information exchange between airlines and national customs. Such interfaces would allow airlines to complete passenger identity verification and entry qualification checks at the ticketing stage, enabling passengers like me to self-service their boarding passes and reduce reliance on manual counters.

Furthermore, with advancements in identity document technology, modern documents now include biometric information and digital signatures for anti-fraud. I propose integrating these technologies into the standardized processing of international travel documents to further enhance the security and verification speed of these documents, reducing boarding delays caused by document issues.

In conclusion, by promoting the digitization and standardization of travel documents, we can not only improve the efficiency of international flight operations but also significantly enhance the travel experience for passengers like myself. This will require collective efforts from the international community, particularly the leadership of the United Nations and other international organizations in setting standards. Through these measures, we can look forward to a more convenient and secure future for international air travel.
