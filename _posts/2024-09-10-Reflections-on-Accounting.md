# Startup Notes: Reflections on Accounting

Before I started my own business, accounting was always a confusing and mysterious field to me. It's only recently that I've begun to understand the core logic of accounting. These are some of my learnings and understandings. If there are any misunderstandings or inaccuracies, please feel free to correct me. I'd be happy if this helps other entrepreneurs who also find this topic confusing.

## The Essence of Accounting

The essence of accounting is actually quite simple:

1. To calculate clearly the things people care about.
2. Since we live in the "real" world, when we look at the same thing from different angles, the conclusions should be the same.

Based on these two points, we can start from the most core statements to understand the logic of accounting.

## Balance Sheet: How Much Do You Have Left?

What do people care about most? If I run a business, how much money do I have left now? Since humans invented borrowing, this question has become: How much money or goods do I have now, which of these belong to me, and which do I need to return to others?

This is one of the most important statements in accounting: the balance sheet. It reflects how total assets are allocated between borrowers and shareholders at a given point in time. This gives rise to the first famous accounting equation:

**Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity**

## Income Statement: How Much Did You Earn?

The second question accounting focuses on is: How much money did I actually make while doing business? This is another important statement: the income statement (or profit and loss statement).

The income statement addresses the question: In a given time period, how much is left after subtracting various expenses from all the income I received? It records the entire process from revenue to final profit.

## Cash Flow Statement: Do You Have Enough Cash?

In the process of running a business, people found that cash is particularly important. Even if you have assets, it's difficult to operate without cash. Especially when it comes to intangible assets, cash needs to be distinguished from other assets.

Therefore, around 1950 to 1970, people proposed a separate method for calculating cash, which is the cash flow statement. It records the beginning cash balance, changes during the period, and ending cash balance, and analyzes the reasons for cash changes (whether caused by earnings or financing activities).

## The Physical Logic of Accounting Equations

From first principles, the physical logic of accounting equations is: Looking at the same thing from two different angles should yield the same result.

- Assets = Shareholders' Equity + Liabilities: This is because shareholders' equity itself is defined as assets minus liabilities.
- Revenue - Expenses = Change in Assets: This reflects the actual situation in the physical world. When you put something into a box, it belongs to that box.
- Cash flow follows the same logic: When you define something as cash and put it in a specific box, it's in that box.

The essence of these equations comes from physical reality.

## The Origin of Double-Entry Bookkeeping

To maintain and verify these equations, double-entry bookkeeping was born. It requires that both sides of the equation be calculated each time, which means that each record needs to be shown on both sides.

## Reflection: Limitations of Accounting Logic

If we think from first principles, we'll find some preset logic:

1. We divide a pool of funds into shareholders' money and creditors' money because humans started lending and borrowing. If there were no lending, there might not be the equation "Assets = Shareholders' Equity + Liabilities", but only "Assets = Assets".
2. If new categories other than liabilities appear in the future, or if some values become variable, this equation may need to be modified. For example:
    1. If the government starts levying a proportional tax on assets, we might need to add "Government Equity" as an item.
    2. Non-profit organizations have issues they care about more than "money", so perhaps they should have another type of statement, such as "headcount". Analogous to the balance sheet, it might become a statement of "Contributors = Volunteers + Employees". And the income statement might become "User Conversion = Increment in Contributors".
    3. Blockchain might change the "Cash Flow" statement. If we frequently deal with different currencies or units of calculation, or if conversions between assets become very frequent, the cash flow statement may no longer have its original meaning.

## Conclusion

Getting back to the essence, the logic of accounting is to calculate clearly what people care about. Combined with human business activities currently based on buying and selling, accounting needs to calculate clearly how much goods we have now, who these goods belong to, and how these goods come in and go out. This forms the three main statements of accounting.

I hope these reflections can help you better understand the core logic of accounting and provide some inspiration for your entrepreneurial journey. Again, I emphasize that this is just my personal understanding, and if there are any shortcomings, please feel free to point them out.
